				<p>I started coding HTML by hand while in college. I went on to do tech support for Macromedia software, mainly Flash and Dreamweaver, which are now part of Adobe's software suite. While employed with Macromedia I took some courses in Java and C++ as well as attempted to teach myself PHP and MySQL through books.</p>
				<p>Later I went on to take classes in HTML5, CSS3, PHP, MySQL, WordPress, JavaScript, and jQuery through Brookhaven College. I've also done Team Treehouse, where I started with Ruby on Rails. In this industry you never stop learning. I know I don't. I continue to learn through videos and books.</p>
